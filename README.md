BUILT WITH VUE, AND JS 

Using the Code Attachments
These code attachments serve two main purposes:
You can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors in your code You can run my code to see what we build / how it should behave


Running my Code
If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment because that would bloat the ZIP file)
2. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
